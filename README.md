# 🕵️ Crime Scene Mapping Tool

This is a front-end crime scene mapping tool I built as part of my capstone project at **Leeds Beckett University (2018)**.

Users can:
- Drag and drop shapes (Rectangle, Square, Circle)
- Add objects like Chair, Sofa, Door
- Insert text clues
- Upload a background image (like a floor plan)
- Save and load crime scene layouts (via localStorage)
